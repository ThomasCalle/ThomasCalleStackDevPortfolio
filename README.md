## My process

I initialized and configured a GitHub repository to maintain version control for this project. The project utilizes GitHub pages to easily publish this project for other to view. 

Once complete, brainstorm a presentable developer portfolio layout which includes: name, recent photo or avatar, connected hyperlinks, resume, about and contact section.

Once brainstormed, generalize all navigational tools to the following assets nessacary - ensure suitable loads and presented items are provided. Ideally creating a User Ineterface(UI) adds an essential level of human connection that allows the user to connect to work and experience.

Though timely, UI that provides; simple but good navigation, visibly presented text, titles and images, functional deployed applications, accessibility screen resizing from desktop to mobile format, with a responsive layout that adapts to the various viewports... creates an ease of access and overall phenomenal experience, as it demostrates your capabilities of work flow and user experience - not to mention, it says alot about your character and how you want others to feel.

Initially created the HTML backbone... proceeeded to the styles the borders and flex boxes to get an idea of how to make the divs flow into place. Once done, I added all the CSS classes and queries to make the style have a easy flow.
